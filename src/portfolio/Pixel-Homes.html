          As the global population continuing shifting from rural area
          to the big cities, the high-density housing is becoming a
          more and more efficient mean to accommodate such drastic changes. A lot of current practices in high-rise housing
          design are highly focused on statistics such as number of
          units, floor-square-ratios, prices, etc. This can be seen from
          the potent of the homogeneous unit layouts, repeated floor
          plan with extrusion to the maximum height, uniformed exterior in most of the high-rise housing projects in cities like
          Vancouver as well as other cities around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          The qualities of life, however, are omitted and becomes the secondary priorities. Compare to the single home
          in rural area, the experience of the living space in most of
          the high-rise buildings are standardized and lacking diversities. One of this reason is caused by the developer-central-
          ized production mode and the lack of user involvement in
          the housing development process. In most scenarios, users
          only have the options to choose the finished units which
          may not suit their diversified needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The decentralized approach, on the other hand, provide a more responsive and participatory system to allow
          the users to directly interact within the design process and
          hence achieve the high level of responsiveness. Through
          the designing rules within and between each user groups,
          the pixel homes propose a decentralized system that based
          on “pixel” rules, each user can shape their own living space
          that define their needs, diversities, ambitions as well as
          their architectural identities.
